## CYNTHIA-perception 
CYNTHIA-perception ( cognitive yielded neural-technological humanoid intuitive application )  is an open-source computer vision library written in C++. It is developed by undergraduate students Samer Ali and Rahul Singh at the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI) at Arizona State University.

The goal of this project is to replicate features and capabilities found in OpenCV through a custom implementation. It serves as a demonstration of computer vision knowledge and skills in developing a complete vision system from the ground up.

#### Features Some major features and components include:

* Image processing operations (filtering, transforms, segmentation, etc)
* Feature detection algorithms (SIFT, SURF, ORB, etc)
* Camera and video I/O support
* GUI and visualization
* Multi-threaded parallelism
* Machine learning integration
