### Concept of Images

an image is a two-dimensional array of samples of pixels, where each pixel consists of number of bits.
"Most common representation of color images are the RGB (red, blue, and green) which is based on trichromatic theory
that the sensation of color is produced by selectively exciting three classes of receptors in the eye."

### color models

*  RGB (red, blue, green)
*  UYV (luminance Y, chrominance U and V)
  * Y = 0.3R + 0.6G + 0.1B
  * V = R - Y
  * U = B - Y

### Digital Cameras

A digital camera typically contains filters with three sensors for each color component in RGB

### Image File Formats

*   GIF: Graphic Interchange Format (limited to 8-bit color images)
*   JPEG: Standard for image compression
*   PNG: Portable Network Graphics
*   TIFF: Tagged Image File Format
*   Windows BMP (BitMap) format
